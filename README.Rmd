# openlpgc

The goal of openlpgc is to provide an R interface in order to extract data from Las Palmas de Gran Canaria City Council [open data site](http://datosabiertos.laspalmasgc.es/). This package uses the [CKAN API](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/contents.html) and is powered by the [ckanr](https://github.com/ropensci/ckanr) package.

## Installation

You can install the released version of openlpgc from Github with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("openlpgc")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
